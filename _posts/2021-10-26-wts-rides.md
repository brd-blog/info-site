> Willing to share rides (WTS).

All trips tagged with the letters **`WTS`** are trips that you could request as a driver for multi-loading.

The number after the word **`WTS`** is the amount of passengers traveling. For example, **`WTS-1`** is a single rider or **`WTS-2`** would be two riders.

Note: No more than three riders. Two riders traveling together will have the back compartment and the single rider in the front.
